# MetaFire
A script that pulls information about Wildfires

## Version 1
You can run this script in Powershell, or the Powershell ISE to grab Wildfire Incident Name, County, Category, and Cause. Size (acres) is pulled as well but that appears to always be empty as of now.
If exports this data to the viewer and it also exports it as a CSV File to c:\Temp\. The CSV needs some work done on it to be more presentable.
